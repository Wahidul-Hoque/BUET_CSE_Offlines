This offline assignment involves implementing array-based stack and linked list-based stack.

Files included:
  stack.h-> header file defining stack interface.
  arraystack.cpp-> implementation of stack using array.
  liststack.cpp-> implementation of stack using linked-list.
  test.cpp-> test functions to verify stack implementations.

Both implementations include constructor, destructor, push, pop,
clear, size, top, empty and print functions. 

test.cpp runs functions to verify correctness and boundary conditions of the stack functions implemented.
If a function behaves correctly it prints PASSED. Otherwise it prints FAILED.
